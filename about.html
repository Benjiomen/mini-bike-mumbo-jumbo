<p> these are two of my mini bikes as you can see that look different compared to conventional pit bikes or dirt bikes and you would be right because even tho they both share the same principals but  they are very different one difference is mini bikes don't have gears like dirt bikes do and most mini bikes don't have suspension unlike dirt bikes  so you might be asking yourself why someone would buy a mini bike and the answer is the amount of aftermarket parts and the modifications you can do to a mini bike is truly unfathomable because you can upgrade the engine you can upgrade the frame you can get a better clutch and much more this makes the mini bike a fun project and activity for minions of americans every day</p>
